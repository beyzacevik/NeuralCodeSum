(remember that the exact result of floating point arithmetic is sensitive to apparently trivial changes such as replacing {@code (a + b) + c} with {@code a + (b + c)}, and that unless {@code strictfp} is in force even the result of {@code (a + b) + c} is sensitive to the jvm's choice of precision for the intermediate result.) this method is recommended when the code under test is specified as either copying a value without modification from its input or returning a well-defined literal or constant value. the check is actually executed by continuing the method chain. for example: <pre>{@code assertthat(actualdoublearray).usingexactequality().contains(3.14159); }</pre> <p>for convenience, some subsequent methods accept expected values as {@link number} instances. these numbers must be either of type {@link double}, {@link float}, {@link integer}, or {@link long}, and if they are {@link long} then their absolute values must not exceed 2^53 which is just over 9e15.

75771,"this method is used to get an alternate type adapter for the specified type. this is used to access a type adapter that is overridden by a {@link typeadapterfactory} that you may have registered. this features is typically used when you want to register a type adapter that does a little bit of work but then delegates further processing to the gson default type adapter. here is an example: <p>let's say we want to write a type adapter that counts the number of objects being read from or written to json. we can achieve this by writing a type adapter factory that uses the <code>getdelegateadapter</code> method: <pre> {@code class statstypeadapterfactory implements typeadapterfactory { public int numreads = 0; public int numwrites = 0; public <t> typeadapter<t> create(gson gson, typetoken<t> type) { final typeadapter<t> delegate = gson.getdelegateadapter(this, type); return new typeadapter<t>() { public void write(jsonwriter out, t value) throws ioexception { ++numwrites; delegate.write(out, value); } public t read(jsonreader in) throws ioexception { ++numreads; return delegate.read(in); } }; } } } </pre> this factory can now be used like this: <pre> {@code statstypeadapterfactory stats = new statstypeadapterfactory(); gson gson = new gsonbuilder().registertypeadapterfactory(stats).create(); // call gson.tojson() and fromjson methods on objects system.out.println(""num json reads"" + stats.numreads); system.out.println(""num json writes"" + stats.numwrites); }</pre> note that this call will skip all factories registered before {@code skippast}. in case of multiple typeadapterfactories registered it is up to the caller of this function to insure that the order of registration does not prevent this method from reaching a factory they would expect to reply from this call. note that since you can not override type adapter factories for string and java primitive types, our stats factory will not count the number of string or primitives that will be read or written. @param skippast the type adapter factory that needs to be skipped while searching for a matching type adapter. in most cases, you should just pass <i>this</i> (the type adapter factory from where {@link #getdelegateadapter} method is being invoked). @param type type for which the delegate adapter is being searched for. @since 2.2"
